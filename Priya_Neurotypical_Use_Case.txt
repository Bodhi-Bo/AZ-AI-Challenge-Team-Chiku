Script 1: Complex Task — Needs Decomposer
User: “Chiku, I need to finish writing and formatting my genetics paper by next Friday. It’s a full publication draft.”
Chiku: “Got it, Priya. That’s a big one. You’ve got lab blocks in the mornings — would you like to use those same hours for writing on off-days?”
User: “Yes, that’s ideal.”
Chiku → [SEND_TO_DECOMPOSER]:
{
  "task_description": "Write, format, and proofread full genetics publication draft.",
  "deadline": "2025-11-21",
  "constraints": ["Prefer morning focus blocks 09:00–12:00", "Avoid teaching Tue/Thu 13:00–15:00"]
}
Decomposer Response: Research review, outline, draft intro, draft methods, draft results, format citations, proofread.
Chiku: “Here’s a proposed writing plan:
- Mon 9–10 → Research review
- Wed 9–10 → Methods section
- Fri 9–10 → Results section
- Mon next week 9–10 → Formatting
- Wed next week 9–10 → Proofreading
Does that look right?”
User: “Yes, perfect.”
Chiku: [MCP_CALL → create_event] “All scheduled. You’ll be ready for submission next Friday!”

Script 2: Simple Event — No Decomposer
User: “Add department coffee chat at 3:30 PM Thursday.”
Chiku: “Sure thing — right after your faculty meeting. I’ll add it 3:30–4:00 PM.”
Chiku → [MCP_CALL → create_event]
{

  "start": "2025-11-13T15:30:00-07:00",
  "end": "2025-11-13T16:00:00-07:00"
}
Chiku: “Done! You’ll have just enough time to grab a seat before it starts.”

Script 3: Event Conflict — Requires Rescheduling
User: “Schedule my advisor meeting for Thursday at 4 PM.”
Chiku (checks calendar): [MCP_CALL → list_events] > Finds conflict with Faculty Meeting (4:00–5:00 PM)
Chiku: “You’ve got a faculty meeting at that time. Would 11 AM before teaching or 5:15 PM after work be better?”
User: “Let’s go with 11 AM.”
Chiku: “Got it — scheduling your advisor meeting Thursday 11–11:45 AM.”
Chiku → [MCP_CALL → create_event]
{
  "title": "Advisor meeting",
  "start": "2025-11-13T11:00:00-07:00",
  "end": "2025-11-13T11:45:00-07:00"
}
Chiku: “All set! You’ll have time to prep before class and stay on top of your projects.”
