Script 1: Complex Task — Needs Decomposer
User: “Hey Chiku, I have this group finance project due next Thursday and I don’t even know where to start. There’s data, a report, and a presentation part.”
Chiku: “Got it, Alex. Let’s make sure you get it done without feeling swamped. When are you working this week?”
User: “Same as usual, mornings Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.”
Chiku: “Perfect. Do you want to work on this in the evenings?”
User: “Yeah, evenings are better.”
Chiku: “Alright, I’ll break this project into smaller parts like data collection, writing, and slide creation so it’s easier to manage.”
Chiku → [SEND_TO_DECOMPOSER]:

  "deadline": "2025-11-20",

}
Decomposer Response: Breaks task into subtasks: data research, spreadsheet setup, report writing, slide design, practice presentation.

Wednesday 7:00 – 7:30pm make slides

Want me to add these blocks to your calendar?”

Chiku: “Yes, and should I put Friday at 7 – 8pm dinner with a friend?”
 User: “Yes, but make it 7 – 9 pm.

Script 2: Simple Event — No Decomposer
User: “Can you add coffee with Taylor at 10 AM Saturday?”
Chiku: “Sure thing. That’s your free day. I’ll add ‘Coffee with Taylor’ from 10:00 to 11:00 AM.”
Chiku → [MCP_CALL → create_event]

Script 3: Event Conflict — Requires Rescheduling
User: “Can you schedule a tutoring session at 2 PM Monday?”
Chiku (checks calendar): [MCP_CALL → list_events] > Finds existing “Finance class 2:00–3:30 PM”
Chiku: “Hmm, you’ve got class at that time. Would 3:45 PM after your class or 12:30 PM before work fit better?”
User: “Let’s do 3:45.”
Chiku: “Perfect — I’ll book your tutoring session for 3:45–4:45 PM.”
Chiku → [MCP_CALL → create_event]
{
  "title": "Finance tutoring session",
  "start": "2025-11-10T15:45:00-07:00",
